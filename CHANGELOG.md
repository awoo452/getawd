### Rewards System Integration

### Added
- **Models**
  - `Reward`: Belongs to a goal; may require specific tasks for eligibility.
  - `RewardRule`: Supports rule-based criteria (e.g., task streaks, calories) associated with a reward.
  - `RewardTask`: Joins specific tasks to rewards when needed.

- **Controllers / Actions**
  - `rewards#index`: Displays all rewards, their status, associated tasks, and available actions.
  - `rewards#new`, `rewards#create`: Enables frontend creation of rewards.
  - `rewards#redeem`: Allows users to redeem eligible rewards.
  - `rewards#evaluate`: Manually re-evaluate rule-based availability.
  - `rewards#destroy`: Supports frontend deletion of rewards.

- **Rule Logic**
  - Implemented flexible rule parsing from `task_name` and `description`.
    - Supports custom conditions like `run_streak`, `calorie_limit`, etc.
  - `eligible?` logic determines if a reward can be redeemed.

### Changed
- **Views / Layout**
