  description: "What a fantastic way to celebrate my birthday weekend! The Nostalgia Drags at Toutle Motorsports Park brought together some of my favorite things—friends gathering to enjoy the thrill of 'old school' drag racing. The event featured an incredible car show, mouthwatering BBQ, and even a scenic river to relax by when we needed to cool off. It was a perfect blend of adrenaline and camaraderie, creating unforgettable memories with good company. I couldn’t have asked for a better way to mark the occasion!",

The highlight was definitely taking Ryder on his first real camping adventure; seeing his excitement made it all the more special. Plus, I can’t forget to shout out a happy birthday to one of my best friends, Daniel! It was an amazing way to celebrate and create lasting memories together in the great outdoors.",
