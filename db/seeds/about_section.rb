    header: "How I Think",
    body: "I approach problems like an analyst. I break systems down, remove unnecessary complexity, and ship solutions that are easy to reason about and extend. I prefer native framework features over heavy dependencies and I design systems to survive real-world usage, not just demos."

    header: "What I've Built",
    body: "I've built and maintained multiple Rails applications end-to-end, handling authentication, background jobs, file storage, deployments, and infrastructure. My projects emphasize clean data models, predictable behavior, and code that someone else can pick up without hating me."

    header: "Why This Exists",
    body: "This site is intentionally mine. There are plenty of platforms to showcase work, but I prefer owning the stack and the decisions behind it. If you're looking for someone who can think clearly, execute independently, and improve systems without overengineering them, we should probably talk."
