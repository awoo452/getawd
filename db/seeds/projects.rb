  title: "GuacAMole",
  description: "This is one of the first JavaScript projects I created while following a freeCodeCamp tutorial—though I decided to put my own spin on it! The original plan was to build a Whack-A-Mole game, but I ended up taking it in a different direction. It was a fun way to get creative while applying the core concepts I was learning, and it gave me the opportunity to experiment with JavaScript in a way that felt unique and personal.",
